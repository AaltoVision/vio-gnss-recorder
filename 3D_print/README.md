# 3D Print

You can use the models `u_blox_casing.stl` and `u_blox_holders.stl` to 3D print a casing for the [C099-F9P application board](https://www.u-blox.com/en/product/c099-f9p-application-board).

## Models
The model `u_blox_casing.stl` is the case itself. The board is attached to the case by four M3 bolts (and the corresponding nuts and washers, of course).

The model `u_blox_holders.stl` contains two 'hooks' that can be used to rest the case on one's laptop's screen. If you want to add them to your setup, print them and drill two M3 holes to the case. The location of the hole depends on your laptop's size.

## Print configuration
The result seen in the pictures was printed with PETG but PLA should also be fine.  

No need to print with dense infill. The print contains small holes and the casing's two halves should fit together; so take that to account when choosing the 'resolution'.
